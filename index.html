<h1 class="section">Uber and Lyft Data in Boston, Massachusetts</h1>
<div class="text">
    Uber and Lyft rides are driven by the supply and demand of riders and drivers.  If rides canâ€™t be planned ahead of time, how can a rider plan to rely on an Uber or Lyft without knowing there will be one nearby at a specific time? Conversely, how can a driver plan to start driving at a certain time and optimize how many rides they give? Perhaps, a driver only wants to drive near certain locations or end at a certain location at a certain time.  This is the nature of the job of being a rideshare driver or being a customer of rideshare apps.  With the inaccessability of public transportation and the decrease in usage of regular taxis, these rideshares have presented solutions.  With the proper data and understanding of these patterns, a driver or a rider can optimize their time spent.

        This plot demonstrates the differences in trends of the customers of Lyft and Uber riders.  A trend that can be noticed is how Lyft rides tend to have a greater increase in price for increase in distance, whereas for Uber the increase is less steep.  This could advise users to choose between Uber or Lyft depending on how much they want to pay and for how long a certain ride will be.  There is also an overall higher density of Uber rides for distances under 5 miles, which indicates that overall Uber is more chosen than Lyft for rides and for rides of these distances.

        This plot demonstrates the network of pickups and dropoffs and the names of the respective locations.  Due to limited data, this network graph only shows pickups and dropoffs in this small area in Boston, Massachusetts.  With greater data, this would be able to help riders and drivers plan where and when to be and if they would likely be able to get a ride on certain days or times based on previous trends.
